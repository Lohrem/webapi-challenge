- Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.
  I learned about middleware and async/await, before when I had experimented with Express and NodeJS,
  my code kept repeating itself since I didn't know about them, but using these two new things that I learned,
  it is much more convenient.

- Describe Middleware?
  Middleware is basically a bridge that connects city A (a database) to city B (an application)

- Describe a Resource?

- What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?
  An alert message or a console log.

- How can we partition our application into sub-applications?
  Taking a big hard problem and breaking it down to simple small problems that when put together, fix the big problem.
